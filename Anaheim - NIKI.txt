RAYHAN RAYA FARABI
I'd give anything to stop time

LAURA TSANAULLAILLA
And drive around Anaheim at sun down 

MAS MUHAMMAD AZRIWINATA
To teach my mind to put you first


DAVID TRI WIJAYANTO
Here you are, a hero

NILUH PUTU PAWESTRI AYUNINGTYAS
You wanna be my new home

STEFANUS ARIO PRABOWO
But baby, let up

ARYA ABHIRAMA
I won't ever recognize these roads

'Cause I am lost, but not in you
Yes, I am lost, but not in you
